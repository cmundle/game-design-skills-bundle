# Game Design Skills Bundle

A curated bundle of reusable game design skills packaged for ChatGPT/Codex,
Claude Code, and other Agent Skills-compatible tools.

This repository collects a set of practical design skills covering:
- emotional direction
- design decision workflows
- player motivation and need audits
- prototyping under uncertainty
- creative unblockers
- FTUE analysis
- pitch deck review

The repository is an installable plugin and local marketplace. Individual
skills can also be installed from `skills/`, or from the prebuilt `.skill`
archives in `package-skills/`.

They also now include `emotional-canvas-moodboard`, a follow-on moodboard skill that turns emotional direction into curated visual boards with candidate-pool gathering, hard rejection, palette-reference support, and clean or annotated JPG/HTML outputs.

They now also include beginner-oriented planning skills for turning rough game concepts into sane first steps, team plans, and budget ranges, plus a project-adjacent collaboration skill for analyzing recurring conflict patterns on software teams.

This repo now also includes a newer extractor/audit pack focused on fantasy, persona, pillars, core loop, failure loop, attribution, flow, fairness/frustration, a deliberately provocative Molyneux-style lens, a fast-vs-slow cognition audit inspired by Thinking, Fast and Slow, plus peak-end and Zeigarnik-effect audits for memory-shape and unfinished-business tension.

- players say something feels unfair, rigged, hostile, or just maddening
- the system is technically functional but emotionally untrusted
- you need to know why frustration points toward quitting instead of mastery

**Best for:**
Trust diagnosis, fairness perception, and retry-worthiness analysis.

---

### game-design-failure-loop-audit

Audits what happens after failure: what players lose, what they learn, how fast they re-enter, and whether the loop creates momentum or resignation.

**Use it when:**
- retry structure feels punishing or exhausting
- the team is tuning death, setback, reset, or recovery systems
- the player dreads the retry more than the challenge itself

**Best for:**
Punishment tuning, retry friction analysis, and post-failure motivation diagnosis.

**Best for:**
Design-principle extraction, focus recovery, and feature-triage alignment.

---

### game-design-core-loop-extractor
**What it does:**
Extracts the actual repeatable core loop from player actions, game response, reward, and renewed motivation.

**Use it when:**
- a pitch sounds like disconnected feature soup
- the design doc lists systems but not the repeatable engine
- you need to separate the core loop from meta layers and progression wallpaper

**Best for:**
Loop clarity, feature-sprawl diagnosis, and motivational structure analysis.

---

### game-design-molyneux-lens
**What it does:**
Stress-tests a concept through a deliberately provocative, ambition-seeking lens that pushes fantasy and reactivity, then grounds the result back into something usable.

---

### game-design-zeigarnik-effect-audit
**What it does:**
Audits a design through the Zeigarnik effect by examining how unresolved tasks, incomplete progress, and open loops create return tension, curiosity, or unhealthy pressure.

**Use it when:**
- a system relies on unfinished business to drive return behavior
- you want to know whether open loops create momentum or just chores and guilt
- quest logs, event tracks, collections, or progression dashboards may be cluttering the player's mind

**Best for:**
Open-loop tension analysis, return-motivation diagnosis, and unfinished-task hygiene.

### 25. game-design-player-segment-perception-audit
**What it does:**
Audits how different player segments are likely to perceive a feature, update, or content drop, especially when the feature is aimed at one cohort but visible to many others.

**Use it when:**
- a feature is targeted at elder or niche players but broadly marketed
- you want to know how new, mid, and elder players will read the same update differently
- you need to catch disappointment caused by visibility-access mismatch

**Best for:**
Segment targeting, feature rollout messaging, and cross-cohort perception analysis.

## Example prompt pack for the 4 game-dev skills

Use the same concept across all four skills to get a beginner-friendly planning stack from first steps -> team gaps -> budget -> timeline.

### 1. game-dev-first-steps
> I want to make a small PC creature-battler with light base-building and asynchronous trading. We are two people: one programmer and one 2D artist. What should we build first, what should we postpone, and what should our smallest believable prototype be?

### 2. game-dev-team-gap
> We want to make a small PC creature-battler with light base-building and asynchronous trading. We are two people: one programmer and one 2D artist. What roles or skills are we missing for a prototype and later for a vertical slice?

### 3. game-dev-budget-estimator
> We want to make a small PC creature-battler with light base-building and asynchronous trading. We are two people: one programmer and one 2D artist, both part-time in Eastern Europe. What rough budget should we expect for a prototype and for a vertical slice, and what costs are probably not covered by our team?

### 4. game-dev-time-estimator
> We want to make a small PC creature-battler with light base-building and asynchronous trading. We are two people: one programmer and one 2D artist, both part-time. How long would a prototype and a vertical slice likely take, what would bottleneck us, and is 6 months realistic for the vertical slice?

### Fast comparison pack

Use these when you want to test skill boundaries quickly.

- **First steps:** What should we build first?
- **Team gap:** Who are we missing?
- **Budget:** What will this likely cost?
- **Time:** How long will this likely take?

## Other installation formats

- OpenClaw: place the folders from `skills/` in the workspace `skills/`
  directory.
- Packaged skills: use the `.skill` archives from `package-skills/`.

## Notes

- Some skills are **audit skills** (diagnose what is true, weak, missing, or risky).
- Some skills are **workflow skills** (help move from ambiguity to action).
- Some intentionally overlap a bit; that is by design. Different framing lenses are useful in different conversations.

## Best starting points

If you are not sure where to begin:
- vague concept -> `game-design-goal-framing`
- no good options yet -> `game-design-option-generation`
- emotionally flat idea -> `game-design-emotional-canvas`
- suspicious engagement loop -> `game-design-player-motivation-audit`
- need to audit social systems, multiplayer structure, or community/status fit -> `game-design-multiplayer-feature-audit`
- weak onboarding -> `game-design-ftue-hero-journey-audit`
- unclear session structure -> `game-design-goal-density-and-immediacy-audit`
- need to map where challenge becomes harmful friction -> `game-design-friction-journey-audit`
- need a behavior-first values profile for personalization or targeting -> `game-design-player-values-mapper`
- player is not truly blocked, but their reading of the current state has gone stale -> `game-design-player-perspective-reframe`
- need to classify social features by satisfaction upside versus dissatisfaction risk -> `game-design-social-satisfaction-matrix`
- need to design prosociality across the arc of repeated multiplayer sessions -> `game-design-prosocial-session-chapters`
- stale discussion -> `game-design-creative-unblocker`
- unclear prototype needs -> `game-design-unknown-unknowns-prototyping`
- upcoming publisher conversation -> `game-design-pitch-deck-audit`
- need to audit whether the design asks for the right kind of cognition -> `game-design-thinking-fast-and-slow-audit`
- need to audit which moments and endings dominate memory -> `game-design-peak-end-audit`
- need to audit whether unfinished business creates momentum or guilt -> `game-design-zeigarnik-effect-audit`
- need structured brainstorming methods -> `game-design-brainstorm-methods`
- suspect the best improvement is subtraction -> `game-design-one-thing-to-remove`
- not sure if the concept is too familiar or too novel -> `game-design-novelty-spectrum-audit`
- want to understand who the design emotionally/structurally appeals to -> `game-design-systematizing-empathizing-audit`
- suspect the KPI framing is undervaluing connective tissue or QoL work -> `game-design-kpi-coverage-audit`
- unclear whether a prototype is for selling or learning -> `game-design-prototype-intent-audit`
- worried different player cohorts will read the same feature differently -> `game-design-player-segment-perception-audit`

at the bottom of its `SKILL.md` and the Required Notice in `LICENSE` need to
travel with it.
